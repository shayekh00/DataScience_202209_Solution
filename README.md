# üìä HAMS Data Science Challenge ‚Äì Bayesian Media Mix Modeling

## üß† Overview

This repository contains my solution to the **HAMS Data Science Challenge**, focused on applying a **Bayesian Media Mix Model (MMM)** using **PyMC** to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing spend across seven paid channels.

The goal was to model delayed effects of marketing, estimate uncertainty, and derive channel-specific return on investment (ROI).

## üîç Approach Summary

- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand revenue trends, channel behavior, and correlations
- Modeled **carryover effects** using exponential adstock transformations
- Built a Bayesian regression model using **PyMC v5**
- Included trend and seasonality as control features
- Validated model with **posterior predictive checks** and visual fit
- Estimated **ROI per channel** from posterior samples
- Tested model robustness by comparing results with and without Channel 7

## ‚úÖ Key Insights

- **Channel 5** emerged as the strongest performer in both ROI and impact
- **Channel 3** showed low ROI and limited contribution
- **Channel 7**, despite high spend, had a weaker marginal effect
- The model captured delayed effects and time dynamics effectively

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Set Up (Conda)

If you‚Äôre using Anaconda or Miniconda, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Create a new environment
conda create -n hams_mmm python=3.10

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate hams_mmm

# 3. Install required packages via pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. (Optional) Add this environment to Jupyter kernels
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=hams_mmm
